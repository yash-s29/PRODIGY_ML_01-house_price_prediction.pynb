# PRODIGY_ML_01-house_price_prediction
 
This project aims to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. A linear regression model is implemented using Python. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated using metrics like mean squared error to assess its accuracy.

# House Price Prediction

This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is built using Python and popular data science libraries.

# Installation:

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries: -pandas -numpy -matplotlib -seaborn -scikit-learn

You can install them using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# How to Run:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yash-s29/PRODIGY_ML_01-house_price_prediction-task-1
.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd House Price Prediction

Run the main script using Python: python house_price_prediction.py

# Data Description:

The project uses two datasets: train.csv: The training dataset containing features such as GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, and the target variable SalePrice. test(2).csv: The test dataset for making predictions. It contains similar features but does not include the target variable.

# Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a validation set. The lower the MSE, the better the model's predictions.
